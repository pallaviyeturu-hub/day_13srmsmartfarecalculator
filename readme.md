\# Day 13 – Smart Bus Fare Calculator



\##  Problem Statement

Design a Smart Bus Fare Calculator for SRM University shuttle system. The program calculates fares based on age, distance, and time of travel, applying discounts and peak hour surcharges.



\##  Concepts Used

\- if-else for conditional fare logic

\- for loop to handle multiple passengers

\- Logical operators (\&\&, ||) for peak hour checks

\- Arithmetic operations for fare calculation



\##  How It Works

1\. Takes number of passengers as input.

2\. For each passenger, collects age, distance, and time.

3\. Applies base fare: ₹10/km.

4\. Applies discounts:

&nbsp;  - Children (<12): 50% off

&nbsp;  - Seniors (>60): 30% off

5\. Applies 20% surcharge during peak hours (8–10 AM, 5–8 PM).

6\. Displays final fare and summary:

&nbsp;  - Total passengers

&nbsp;  - Total revenue

&nbsp;  - Highest and lowest fare
